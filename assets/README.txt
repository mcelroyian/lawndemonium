Placeholders to create in-editor or externally:

- tileset.png (32x32 tiles):
  - grass_bad, grass_ok, grass_good, weed, dirt, boundary, cursor

Notes:
- You can start with flat-color Tiles in the TileSet editor and skip an external PNG initially.
- For web export, add an HTML5 preset and build to export/web/.
